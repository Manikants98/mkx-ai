"**Welcome to Our Interactive Learning Session!**\n\nI'm excited to share something new with you. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of **Webpage Design**.\n\nHere's a brief overview of what we'll be covering:\n\n* The basics of webpage design\n* Understanding different types of webpages\n* Key concepts and terminology\n\n**What would you like to learn about webpage design?**\n\n1. **History of Webpage Design**: Learn about the evolution of web design and how it has impacted the way we interact with the internet.\n2. **Types of Webpages**: Discover the different types of webpages, including static, dynamic, and interactive webpages.\n3. **Webpage Structure**: Understand the basic components of a webpage, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n4. **Webpage Layout**: Learn about the different layout options for webpages, including grid, flexbox, and responsive design.\n5. **Webpage Accessibility**: Explore the importance of making webpages accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.\n6. **Webpage Security**: Understand the basics of webpage security, including HTTPS, SSL, and password protection.\n\nChoose a topic that interests you the most!\n\n**Understanding useState in React**\n\nIn React, `useState` is a Hook that allows you to add state to functional components. Here's the code for `useState`:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useState(initialState) {\n  // Check if the component has already been initialized\n  if (!this.hasRendered) {\n    this.hasRendered = true;\n    this.state = initialState;\n    this.setState = this.setState.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  // Return the current state and a function to update it\n  return [this.state, this.setState];\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this is not the actual implementation of `useState` in React. The actual implementation is more complex and involves some internal state management.\n\n**What you need to know about useState:**\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the component, which is passed as an argument to the `useState` Hook.\n2. **Current State**: The current state of the component, which is returned by the `useState` Hook.\n3. **setState**: A function that updates the state of the component.\n\n**Example usage of useState:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `useState` Hook to create a state variable `count` with an initial value of 0. We then use the `setCount` function to update the state when the button is clicked."
