"## Webpage #0:\n### React useEffect Hooks\n\nThe `useEffect` Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are:\n\n* Fetching data\n* Directly updating the DOM\n* Timers\n\n`useEffect` accepts two arguments:\n\n* The first argument is a function that contains the side effect code.\n* The second argument is an optional dependency array.\n\n### Example 1: Use `setTimeout` to count 1 second after initial render\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Timer() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      setCount((count) => count + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n\n  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Timer />);\n```\n\n### Example 2: Only run the effect on the initial render\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Timer() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      setCount((count) => count + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n  }, []); // <- add empty brackets here\n\n  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Timer />);\n```\n\n### Example 3: Here is an example of a `useEffect` Hook that is dependent on a variable\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [calculation, setCalculation] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setCalculation(() => count * 2);\n  }, [count]); // <- add the count variable here\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+</button>\n      <p>Calculation: {calculation}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Counter />);\n```\n\n### Example 4: Effect Cleanup\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nfunction Timer() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let timer = setTimeout(() => {\n      setCount((count) => count + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n\n    return () => clearTimeout(timer);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;\n}\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<Timer />);\n```\n\n## Webpage #1:\n### useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.\n\n`useEffect` is a Hook that lets you perform side effects in your components. It's a way to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a database or an API.\n\n### Example 1: Connecting to an external system\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Webpage #2:\n### Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\nThe `useEffect` Hook lets you perform side effects in function components.\n\n### Example 1: Using `useEffect` to update the document title\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Webpage #3:\n### Nothing found\n\n## Webpage #4:\n### Hi friends !\n\nI'm quite new to ReactJS and there are some concepts that I can't figure out. One of them is `useEffect...`\n\nI really don't get the difference between using `useEffect` and simply calling a function... I looked the documentation but it's not clearing my mind...\n\nSomeone can explain me `useEffect` like I was 5 years old ?\n\nThanks !! \n\n## Webpage #5:\n### You wrote a few components with Hooks. Maybe even a small app. You’re mostly satisfied. You’re comfortable with the API and picked up a few tricks along the way. You even made some custom Hooks to extract repetitive logic (300 lines gone!) and showed it off to your colleagues. “Great job”, they said.\n\nBut sometimes when you `useEffect`, the pieces don’t quite fit together. You have a nagging feeling that you’re missing something. It seems similar to class lifecycles… but is it really? You find yourself asking questions like:\n\n* How do I replicate `componentDidMount` with `useEffect`?\n* How do I correctly fetch data inside `useEffect`? What is `[]`?\n* Do I need to specify functions as effect dependencies or not?\n* Why do I sometimes get an infinite refetching loop?\n* Why do I sometimes get an old state or prop value inside my effect?\n\n## Webpage #6:\n### useEffect is one of those React/Preact hooks that most people have a love/hate relationship with, but like it or not, it's good to understand how it works.\n\nThis is not the first blog post on the subject, and it's certainly not going to be the last, but hopefully I can explain some things to you about when (and why!) it runs in your applications for you to use as a reference!\n\n### Code of `useEffect`\n\n```jsx\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // your fetch call, changes, etc\n    return () => {\n      // clean-up\n    };\n  }, [dependencyArray]); // we're staying in sync with this\n}\n```\n\n### Dependency Array\n\nThe second parameter of `useEffect` is called the dependency array. There are three things that can happen here:\n\n* If the dependency array is empty, `useEffect` is only called once.\n* If it doesn't exist (like it's omitted entirely), then `useEffect` is called on every state change.\n* If it has a variable in it, then `useEffect` is called when that variable changes.\n\n### Return Function\n\nWhenever `useEffect` is about to be called again, or whenever the component is about to be dismounted/destroyed, the \"clean-up function\" is called."
